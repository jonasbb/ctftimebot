    "description": "The qualification round will yet again be in the style of game board, but answers need not be in the form of a question.\r\nCategories will require teams to demonstrate the superiority of hacking across a vast realm of security knowledge and practice, and their ability to form coherent questions.\r\n\r\nQuit \"playing\" with your shake-weight on leatherchapsroulette.com long enough to visit ddtek.biz to register. Only those that pre-register for quals are permitted entry. Each individual should register, first team member to register will receive a team code to share with other mates before they register. \r\n\r\nRegistration site: <a href=\"https://www.ddtek.biz/reg/dc19_reg.jsp\">https://www.ddtek.biz/reg/dc19_reg.jsp</a>\r\nRegistration opens: 01 Apr 2011 00:00:00 UTC\r\nRegistration ends: 03 Jun 2011 00:00:00 UTC\r\n\r\nQualifications open: 03 Jun 2011 19:00:00 UTC\r\nQualifications ends: 06 Jun 2011 01:00:00 UTC\r\n\r\nIn hysteretical fashion ACME Pharm will be automatically be permitted contest entry. NEW THIS YEAR! We are also pre-qualifying teams from two other worldwide CTFs! We have scientifically chosen the iCTF and Codegate contests as potentially worthy qualifiers for 2011. The winners of said competitions have reserved seats at this years show. As always, pre-qualified teams that don't participate in quals should be ashamed by their weakness and apply to be a CEH or SANS instructor / cyber security poser. Depending on how these teams fare, future winners of these contests may or may not be invited again, so you bitches better represent!\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be fair to reduce the number of spots available to the public at large, so we're upping the number of tables in Vegas to 12 total. Yes, when the dust clears the _12_ best will be invited to join us this summer in sin city for the annual DEFCON deathmatch.\r\n\r\nAlso, DDTEK is tired of this bullshit[2] and has decided to fix it by jumping on the certification band wagon! Be sure to swing by the CTF room to attempt to obtain the GIAC-OFFENSIVE certification in person. It is _certainly_ the only cert anyone wants to be affiliated with. HR panties and manties are definitely gonna get wet over this one.\r\n\r\nMore infoz will follow via your registered email address.\r\n\r\nVulc@n\r\nDifensiva Senior Engineer, GIAC-OFFENSIVE\r\nDiuntinus Defense Technologies, plc., Co., Gmbh., Inc.\r\n",

    "description": "The time draws near for the third annual Ghost in the Shellcode (GitS) Capture the Flag (CTF) event at ShmooCon!\r\n\r\nEach year the competition has grown more challenging and this year is no exception. As before the game format will consist of question-and-answer style challenges that are arranged throughout multiple categories, with challenges for both newbies and elite hackers alike. To add to the fun, this years competition will feature a special new category that has never been seen before in any other CTF competition. We think you're going to love it!\r\n\r\nTo raise the level of competition another notch, this year will also be the first year that GitS CTF will be online so that hackers not attending ShmooCon can also participate in the event. However, most prizes will be limited to the teams that are playing onsite at the conference.\r\n\r\nTo get a feel for the type of questions you might come across, last year's challenges are online:  http://ghostintheshellcode.com\r\n\r\nJust to get the juices flowing the GitS CTF will be hosting another online warmup round. As before, the winning prize will be a coveted ShmooCon barcode.\r\n\r\nThe event will be kicking off at 6pm on January 6th, and will run into 6pm on January 7th, or until all challenges have been solved (last year all challenges were solved, so we thought that was a good excuse\r\nto add more this year).\r\n\r\nMore detail (as always) available at <a href=\"http://ghostintheshellcode.com/\">http://ghostintheshellcode.com/</a>\r\n\r\nAny question can be directed to gits@ghostintheshellcode.com, and you can always follow us on twitter for more info http://twitter.com/shellghostcode.",

    "description": "The challenge is conducted according to the CTF (Capture the Flag) game rules. Several teams are to defend their own networks and attack the networks of other teams for a specified period of time. The aim of the contestants is detecting vulnerabilities in the systems of other competing teams and obtaining sensitive information (flags), and at the same time detecting and fixing vulnerabilities in their own systems.\r\n\r\nThe key feature of Positive Hack Days CTF is its closeness to real-life conditions. All the vulnerabilities are not fictional, but indeed occur on contemporary information systems. Moreover, the format of PHDays CTF is really wide due to the game environment\u2019s saturation with unique elements (such as capturing and keeping control of the systems according to the King of the Hill principles, the option of solving game problems blindly \u2014 i.e. attacking systems without any access to them, etc.). CTF contestants will try themselves in real struggle and get a chance to develop their own information protection solutions.\r\n\r\nTo add special appeal to the contest, the game infrastructure is prepared and changed according to the story lines which are unique for each contest within PHDays CTF. Such conditions create a remarkable ambience and make the Positive Hack Days CTF contest to stand out against the background of other similar contests. ",

DEFCON XX, it's two-thirds sheepornographic!\r\n\r\nIn case you have been under a rock, DEFCON 20 is poised to be the largest it has ever been, thousands and thousands of hackers, high end entertainment and non-stop action to rival m3rc's in romps New Zealand's sheep country.\r\n\r\nSo get your 50 gal. discount lube handy (use coupon code DDTEKNEEDZLUBEZ) and get ready to be pwned...the no-holds-barred competition for these coveted spots will be held over 48 non-stop hours 1-3 June (US time zones).\r\n\r\nThe qualification round will require teams to demonstrate the superiority of cyber, security, and hacking across a vast realm of security knowledge, practice and CISSP DRE exam prep questions.\r\n\r\nDT asked DDT to grow the CTF. So we have. We are pre-qualifying winners of other CTFs around the globe to bring a smackdown of epic proportions this August.\r\n\r\nAs always, last year's champion, the Euopean Nopsled Team, is granted automatic entry. There are so many CTFs on the circuit these days, we seek to incorporate only the best of the best.\r\n\r\nSo, random, wandering sheep have selected the following CTFs using a scientifically proven \"pin the tail on the m3rc\" (role reversal--who knew?) method.\r\n\r\nLast year the iCTF and Codegate winners demonstrated that winners of these CTFs were worthy of returning, additionally we invite victors from NCCDC, HitB, PhDays, nuit du hack, RuCTFE, and Defcon 19 oCTF.\r\n\r\nThe winners of said competitions have reserved seats at this years show.\r\n\r\nWhile DEFCON refuses to sell-out to corporate sponsorship, DT is personally covering two rooms per team at the majestic RIO hotel Thursday-Sunday for each team.\r\n\r\nIn honor of DC XX we're upping the number of tables in Vegas to 20 total. Yes, when the dust clears the _20_ best will be invited to join us this summer in sin city for the annual DEFCON deathmatch. It wouldn't be fair to reduce the number of spots available to the public at large, so 10 teams will qualify in open quals this June.\r\n\r\nReg is at ddtek.biz. Only those that pre-register for quals are permitted entry. Each individual should register. The first member of each team to register will receive a team code to privately share with other mates as they register. Just go to the dam site and register. It's not hard (registration that is), and lusers that can't bother themselves to register in the next eight weeks will be required to wear sheep hatz to Defcon (http://bit.ly/HCIQQy). Consider this your first challenge, those that successfully register will receive 5 schrute bucks (Schrute buck to bitcoin to sheepantler to qualpoint conversion scale will be available at a later date).\r\n\r\nRegistration site: https://www.ddtek.biz/reg/dc20_reg.jsp\r\nRegistration opens: 01 Apr 2012 00:00:00 UTC\r\nRegistration ends: 01 Jun 2012 00:00:00 UTC \r\n\r\nhttps://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-20/dc-20-ctf.html\r\nhttps://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=12796\r\n\r\nFor those mathy types, you'll notice that one seat is not accounted for, stay tuned for a surprise announcement during quals weekend.\r\n\r\nMore infoz will follow via your registered email address.\r\n\r\nVulc@n\r\nDifensiva Senior Engineer, GIAC-OFFENSIVE\r\nDiuntinus Defense Technologies, plc., Co., Gmbh., Inc.",

    "description": "OVERVIEW\r\nTo celebrate the 10th year anniversary of HITBSecConf, the CTF Overlords and CTF Crews 1.0, 2.0 and the all-new 3.0 will be coming together to work on a 32 HOUR NON STOP CAPTURE THE FLAG COMPETITION which we\u2019re calling CTF Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 Fallout Apocalypse!\r\nIn our previous CTF Weapons of Mass Destruction, Teams had a set of daemons / services running on their machines and they had to exploit rival teams\u2019 daemons to steal their flags. Submit the flags to obtain offensive points and also unlock nuclear weapons that can be launched against rival teams. For defensive points, all the team had to do was to keep their daemons up and running.\r\nFallout Apocalypse will require each team to manage a nuclear power plant and protect their daemons, which represents the reactor\u2019s cores, from attacks while at the same time launch attacks against rival teams\u2019 nuclear reactor. Weaponized SCADA exploits can be used to cause monetary damage towards rival teams. Fallout Apocalypse will also feature a spanking new black market where teams may trade exploits and also purchase countermeasures.\r\nDETAILED EXPLANATION\r\nEach team will start with an equal amount of money which represents their points. More money can be obtained periodically by making sure daemons are all up and running during a flag check initiated by the score server. Money can also be obtained by achieving \u201cBreak through Points\u201d, which will be awarded to the first team who manages to solve a daemon, or in other words, be the first to steal a flag via a particular daemon.\r\nBy solving a daemon, not only will the team be awarded with points, the team will also be awarded with a Weaponized SCADA exploit that can be launched against a rival team. There will be a total of ten (10) daemons all together, hence ten (10) weaponized SCADA exploits available for each team to acquire. No extra points will be awarded to the team that launches it, however monetary damage will be inflicted against the target team. If a team\u2019s money reaches zero (0), the team will automatically be kicked out of the competition. Keep in mind that each weaponized SCADA exploit may only be used once. Depending on the difficulty of exploitation of the daemon, each weaponized SCADA exploit will carry a different damage rating.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, Fallout Apocalypse will feature a Black Market where teams can conveniently purchase items from the shop and also trade exploits amongst each other.  Items such as protection and countermeasures can be purchased while on the other hand, teams who wish to auction off their exploits can do so via a broker (The CTF Crew). The owner of the exploit will inform the broker of starting price and the broker will auction it off to the highest bidder. The profit obtained from the purchase will be added to the seller\u2019s pot of gold (total points).\r\nAt the end of the competition, the team with the most money (total points) will be crowned as the winner. Hence, teams will need to make sure their daemons are up and running and also harvest flags from time to time for more points. Flags are changed periodically to allow teams to obtain more points by harvesting flags. The CTF network will be isolated from the rest of the conference network, and we will NOT provide Internet on the CTF network. However, you are free to use the HITB conference wireless network.",

The enphasis is on the way teams are versatile and how they use their skills. Like in the friday night, points are gained by exploiting vulnerabilities. Challenges generally have the following caracteristics:\r\n\r\nPretty easy to understand\r\nDifficulty ranges from easy to hard\r\nVariety to please everyone\r\nHere are the challenges of this year. (Note that they\u2019re subject to change):\r\n\r\n-Web-\r\n\r\nYour goal is to find and exploit vulnerabilities exposed by various websites. Your analytical skills will be solicited more than ever in this edition. You\u2019ll need to read between the lines of code.\r\n\r\nThe challenges of the past years could serve as warm-up.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hackfest.ca/hacking-games/anciens-jeux\r\n\r\n-Phony app-\r\n\r\nAndroid, Windows Phone, iOS\u2026 Is there such a thing as mobile security?\r\n\r\n-Exploits-\r\n\r\nNMAP is a pretty good tool, but unfortunately it won\u2019t get you root on the box.\r\n\r\n-Crypto-\r\n\r\nHow are you supposed to communicate with the real world\u2026 in plain text? Welcome to 2012.\r\n\r\n-Crackme-\r\n\r\nBring some computation power to crack those hashes you will find on your way to salvation. This track will be integrated into others.\r\n\r\n-Trivia-\r\n\r\nIRC quizz-style trivia led by our famous host, ChuckNorris. Questions will be related to anything ITsec, hacking, scene, history, etc. They will range from general knowledge to specific technical questions\r\n\r\n-Lock Picking-\r\n\r\nAll details here: http://www.hackfest.ca/en/hacking-games/lock-picking-pro-clef\r\n\r\n-Data mining-\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re gonna stumble on some informations, find out what to do with them or find out about different ways to present information.\r\n\r\nRegistration: You must register by e-mail before 6:00 PM, eastern time, to have your team on the scoreboard\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n==== FRIDAY NIGHT CHALLENGE ====\r\n\r\n-=Registration=-\r\nhttp://www.hackfest.ca/en/hacking-games/friday\r\n\r\n-=Scenario=-\r\nIn 2010, two (2) pharmaceutical companies went head-to-head in a winner take all cyber-battle to obtain a lucrative contract. The winner would surely be considered as the world leader in pharmaceutical products, making investors rich beyond belief.\r\n\r\nThis year, Hackfest is presenting a similar scenario, only this time a multitude of corporate entities will be battling it out in what is today\u2019s most hostile environment: The Internet. Keeping the same model as previous years, teams will not only need to attack, but also defend their respective networks in order to obtain the ultimate prize. Players will be placed in a war mood and in a realistic environment. Players should be see:\r\n\r\n  - An internet simulation\r\n  - An anonymity system\r\n  - A military base with a SCADA system\r\n  - An international bank\r\n  - Multiple operating system such as: CentOS, Windows and Debian\r\n  - IPv6 telephony systems\r\n  - And More\u2026\r\n\r\nPlayers can already get ready for the games! See details on the web site.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the hackfest \u201cRed / Blue\u201d contest , please see the last two years editions pages.",

    "description": "Overview\r\n========================\r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is for teams (maximum of 3 participants per team) to gain as many points as possible by defending their servers and attacking other teams\u2019 servers. \r\n\r\nTeams will be given identical pre-configured vmware image of an Linux installation \u2013 the root password will not be given to the team. There will be daemons running on the servers. Some daemons are puzzle-based challenges and some contain vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow, format string and so on. \r\n\r\nThe teams\u2019 objective is to analyze the daemons, find vulnerabilities and write exploits. A working exploit will enable the team to attack other teams' servers, retrieving the flag associated with each daemon running on the server and thus scoring an offensive point. The ability to keep the daemons running will enable the teams to score a defensive point. \r\n\r\nScoring\r\n========================\r\n\r\nOffensive Points = Gained by hacking into other team\u2019s server and retrieving their flags.\r\n\r\nDefensive Points = Gained by keeping your server\u2019s daemons running.\r\n\r\nChallenge Points = Gained by submit the correct flags for challenges\r\n\r\nTotal points = offensive points + defensive points + challenge points\r\n\r\nIn order to score an offensive point, all that a team needs to do is hack into other team\u2019s server, retrieve the flag, and submit it to the score server. In order to get a defensive score, teams must keep their daemons running and accessible by the crew. Flag checks will be done randomly. If a flag check fails, teams will not gain a defensive point. Flags will be reset randomly as well, thus teams are allowed to harvest flags to gain more offensive points.\r\n\r\nHigher points are given for offensive attacks as opposed to defensive scores. Defensive scores are the same for all daemons while offensive scores vary depending on the complexity level of the exploit needed. The first team able to exploit the daemon will gain a \u2018breakthrough point\u2019.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the competition, the team with highest total points will be the one who rules the world! In case of two different teams having the same points, whichever team is quickest to reach the highest points will be declared the winner. As such, teams are advised to submit the flags as soon as they obtain them.\r\n\r\nThe CTF network will be isolated from the rest of the conference network and we will NOT provide Internet access on the CTF network. You are free to use the HITB conference wireless network.",

Sony's Betamax Video Tape Recorder, and the time-shifting it enabled, were ruled legal, creating the precedent necessary for countless technological innovations we now use every day. But what if, as it very nearly did, that decision had gone the other way? V& invites you to find out at OpenCTF: DRMageddon.\r\n\r\nIn OpenCTF, teams compete to solve hacking challenges in a wide variety of categories, including web, forensics, programming, cryptography and reverse engineering. There will be challenges for all skill levels. If you've never played in a capture the flag contest before, please feel free to stop by anyway - we'll explain how it works and do what we can to set set up with a team. Optional preregistration, as well as some tips on what to bring and how to prepare, can be found at OpenCTF.com.\r\n\r\nYou must have at least one team member attending DEFCON to play OpenCTF.

    "description": "The theme of the 2015 iCTF is \u201ccrowdsourcing evil\u201d also known as \"making bad\".\r\nIn order to participate to the iCTF, each team has to write a vulnerable service. \r\nThe service must follow precise specifications (a document describing the service specs and an example of a service will follow). \r\nThe service will then be put in the vulnerable image and will become part of the competition. \r\nOf course, the team who created the service will not be able to score against that service, but all the others are fair game.\r\nThe service can be web-based or use a stdin/stdout-over-[x]inetd style.\r\n\r\nOne important question is: How difficult should the vulnerability in the service be?\r\nIf the vulnerability is too easy (i.e., too many teams will be able to break into the service) your team will be penalized.\r\nIf the vulnerability is too difficult (i.e., not enough teams will be able to break the service) your team will also be penalized.\r\nOf course, finding the right balance is difficult, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a challenge!\r\nSo, during the iCTF you can imagine that the services will be ordered by the number of teams that exploited the service.\r\nThis order is then used as an index in a statistical distribution to determine service points.\r\nThe service points are then composed with more traditional points (attack points, defense points, and SLA points) to copmute the final score.\r\n\r\nBe the best at finding the right balance in vulnerability complexity and you will gain an edge over the other teams!\r\n\r\nNote that some things are different this time around:\r\n\r\n1) We will not run your exploits on your behalf, like we did the past few years\r\n\r\n2) All interaction with the iCTF will be through a Python module. \r\nAfter you execute \"pip install ictf\" you will be able to register and provide your credentials/services/matadata through functions from the ictf module.\r\n\r\nNote that the services are due on November 20th (of course, you need to register before that date as well).\r\nIf you have not provided a service by then, you will NOT participate in the iCTF.\r\n\r\nAlso please consider the fact that your team's service will be shared with all the other teams.\r\nIf your service is lame, you will be mocked forever.\r\nIf your service is cool, you will be celebrate as the elite team you are.\r\n\r\nNote that the competition is open only to teams from educational institutions. \r\nWe will require a faculty POC who will be responsible for the ethical behavior of the team.\r\n\r\nWe will run a lot of your code during service installation, so please try to be nice and avoid trying to hack the platform ;-)\r\n\r\nMore details about service creation will follow. In the meanwhile, start thinking about the service you want to submit to enter the competition.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n",

Do not share the flags with others, don't spoil the fun. - After August 28 we will announce the winners and contact them to ask for a physical address to ship the board. - Every welcome challenge gives you one point. The score counts towards your overall RHme3 progress. - Even if you plan to participate in the main challenge as a team, please solve the welcome challenges individually. - We rank the results based on the number of challenges solved and dates of flags submission: - Those who solved all three challenges and were the first to submit the flags. - Those who solved at least two challenges and were the first to submit the flags. - Those who solved at least one challenge and were the first to submit.",
